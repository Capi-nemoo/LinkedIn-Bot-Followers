## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to the **LinkedIn Follower Bot**! This Python script automates the process of following accounts on LinkedIn, designed to enhance your networking capabilities while ensuring the safety of your account. Build professional connections effortlessly and manage your LinkedIn presence with ease!

### Key Features

- **Automated Account Following**: Automatically follow potential connections based on your LinkedIn network growth.
- **Weekly Limits**: Prevents exceeding a threshold (100 accounts) to avoid flags or restrictions from LinkedIn.
- **Daily Execution Check**: Ensures the bot runs only once a day.
- **Log Management**: Maintains logs of the accounts followed along with dates for easy tracking.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required library by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Chrome Browser
- LinkedIn Account
- Proper setup of paths in the script

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LinkedIn-Follower-Bot.git
   cd LinkedIn-Follower-Bot
   ```

2. Modify the paths in the script as necessary for your system.

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python LinkedInFollower.py
   ```

## üìú Usage

The script will read from `AccountLog.txt` to check prior follow activity and will execute the follow actions accordingly. The following sequence occurs:

1. Checks if the bot has run today or if the weekly following limit has been reached.
2. Launches Chrome.
3. Scrolls through the LinkedIn network page to find accounts to follow.
4. Follows accounts dynamically until the limit is reached.
5. Logs the activity/date in `AccountLog.txt`.
