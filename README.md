## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required library by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Chrome Browser
- LinkedIn Account
- Proper setup of paths in the script

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Connor9994/LinkedIn-Follower-Bot.git
   cd LinkedIn-Follower-Bot
   ```

2. Modify the paths in the script as necessary for your system.
   ```
   browserPath = Your Chrome Directory
   (Windows: C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe)
   
   profilePath = Where you want to save your LinkedIn User Data
   (Eg. C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\LinkedIn Follower Bot\Users\LinkedIn)

   LoggedIn = (1 - Logged In / 0 - Logged Out)
   Run Script w/ 0, log in to LinkedIn, press enter to save the Cookies/Etc to profilePath
   Change LoggedIn to 1
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python LinkedInFollower.py
   ```

## üìú Usage

The script will read from `AccountLog.txt` to check prior follow activity and will execute the follow actions accordingly. The following sequence occurs:

1. Checks if the bot has run today or if the weekly following limit has been reached.
2. Launches Chrome.
3. Scrolls through the LinkedIn network page to find accounts to follow.
4. Follows accounts dynamically until the limit is reached.
5. Logs the activity/date in `AccountLog.txt`.

## üöß Disclaimer

Use this bot responsibly. Automation goes against the Terms of Service of LinkedIn, and excessive use will result in account restrictions. Always ensure to adhere to LinkedIn guidelines. This is for educational purposes only!

## üìß Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests to improve the script, enhance features, or fix bugs.
